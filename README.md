# README Generator

## Description 
  This is a README generator I made using NODE.  NODE allowed me to create and use JavaScript code to make this project.  It is fully interactive within VSCODE.  Because of this it will require being pulled to function

## Installation
  First pull the REPO using you SSH key.  Once pulled open in VSCODE.  Once opened in VSCODE open your integrated terminal.  Then type "npm i" to install the required node modules.  After downloaded type "node index.js" and follow the questions in the terminal to create your README.
